# MongoDB Database

MongoDB is NoSQL database which has a JSON like (BSON data) data storage.

## Setting up Database Server and Connecting with Mongo Shell

After installing MongoDB community server package on your system - you will have to start the database server using command :

```bash
mongod
```

This will start MongoDB server on default port 27017. You might have to create a directory for storage in MongoDB - if server asks for storage directory

Once server is started - you can use `mongo` client to connect to local server

```bash
mongo
```

Now you can use several commands to work with database:

```
show dbs
```

This will list all the database in your system

```
use <dbname>
```

This will command will let you switch to a particular <dbname>

## Understanding MongoDB structure

1. Hostname
2. Database
3. Collection
4. Document

Hostname is Database server address - like `localhost` or `db.xy.com`. In mongoDB hostname generally uses mongodb protocol to connect.
So URLs are generally are of shape : `mongodb://localhost:27017`

Database are topmost storage level of your data - mostly each application has 1 database - however complex application might have more than 1 databases. Database is something like `university database`

There can be many collections inside a database - collection is a group of documents of similar kind - `students`, `teachers`, `courses` etc

Finally document is basic entity of storage in Mongod, it looks very similar to an object in JSON. (However it is BSON)


## MONGO CLI


Mongo DB community server comes with in-bulit Mongo CLI which can act as a terminal based client. You can use the CRUD functionality from here 

Read the commands [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongo-shell/)

## Lab Task 1

* Try these commands given in Mongo CLI reference docs. 
1. Show database
2. Use database
3. Show collection
4. Create Query (insertOne, insertMany)
5. Read Query (find, findOne)
6. Update Query (updateOne)
7. Delete Query (deleteOne, deleteMany)
8. Delete database (drop)


## Mongodump and Mongorestore

These utilities comes with community server and can be found in CMD/terminal. They are not the part of Mongo CLI client.

1. Mongodump command is used to take backup of complete database or some collections

```bash

mongodump  --db accounts 
```
Above command takes backup of database `accounts` and stores into a directory named `dump`

2. Mongorestore command is used to restore database

```bash

mongorestore --db accounts dump/accounts

```

Above command restore your database `accounts` from backup directory `dump`

## Lab Task 2

Use these commands on terminal/CMD (not inside mongo client)

1. Take a backup of database you created in Lab task 1.

2. Restore the backup of database from `dump` directory.




## Using MONGODB NODE.JS DRIVER  [ OPTIONAL READING ]

To install MONGODB NODE.JS DRIVER use this command

```javascript
npm install mongodb
```

You can setup database in Node server using following commands :

```javascript

const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const assert = require('assert');

// Connection URL
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';

// Database Name
const dbName = 'myproject';

// Use connect method to connect to the Server
MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, client) {
  assert.equal(null, err);
  console.log("Connected correctly to server");

  const db = client.db(dbName);

});
```

Now this `db` handle can be used to perform any CRUD operation using MongoDB NodeJS driver.
